# Benchmarks
Simple repository comparing the Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi IO Board compute module
and the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

Tests for RPI's and Jetson Nano:
* Sequential performance 
* CPU multithreading performance
* SIMD and cache performance


Tools used and needed:
* gprof for baseline benchmarks and code execution performance
* prof for flamegraphs
* NVCC for CUDA compilation
* g++ for C++ compilation

Logic/algorithms implemented
* Matrix arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
* Primality Tests & Generation
* TODO...
